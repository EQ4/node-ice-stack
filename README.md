## node-ice-stack

node-ice-stack is intended to implement Icecast's source protocol (basically 
HTTP, but with the SOURCE verb and using ICE/1.0).  It is being written for 
[StreamMachine](http://github.com/StreamMachine/StreamMachine).

The code is starting as a coffee rewrite of 
[node-http-stack](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-stack).
